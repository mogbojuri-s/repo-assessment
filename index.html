 <p><h4>Exotic dance moves</h4></p>
 <p>Yes you are right ! As part of my most post doctorate work , i did study exoctic tribal dance,To answer your question,my favorite dance are as follows,with definition</p>
 <p><ul><li>Polyynesain chicken dance.</li></ul></p>
 <p>A little known but very influential dance dating have far as 300 Bc in a circle like chicken, to encourage thier live stock to be fruitful.</p>
 <p><ul><li>Icelandic brownian Shuffles</li></ul></p>
 <p>Before the icelanders developed fire as a means of getting warm ,they used to practice this dance,which invovle huddling close together in a circle on the floor, and shuffling thier bodies around in imperciptibly tiny, very rapid movements. one of the fellow students usedused to say that he thought this dance inspire modern styles auch as twerking.</p>
 <p><ul><li>Arctiic robot dance</li></ul></p>
<p>An interesting example of historic misinformation, English explorer in the 1960s believe ro have discovered a new dance style characterised by 'robotic',stiiled movements, being practised by inhabitants of Northern Alaska and Canada . Later on however it was discovered that they were just moving like this because they were really cold.</p>
 <p>For more of my research, see my <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/">exotic dance research page</a></p>
